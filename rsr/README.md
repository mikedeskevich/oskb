# Russian Squat Routine

A classic squat routine. This works best with grinds - Squats, Deadlifts - but I've also used it for pull-ups (for folks who needed a boost to get past a plateau).  When used with the quick lifts, it's a good way to end the session.  Do this 3 days a week for 6 weeks. It's really only good about once a year or less.  Done right, it's really taxing.
