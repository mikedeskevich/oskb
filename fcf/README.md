# FCF

I'm being purposely vague on this one. If you know me and how I'm related to FCF, then you'll like this. Before the gym was sold and the website was purged from existence. I was able to crawl the site and save all of the workouts. Toward the end, they were too Crossfit-y, but the early 2008-2010 workouts were a great combination of intensity and strength training (at least for 30-year-old me).

Included here is all of the workouts with the rants and commentary stripped out. 

Enjoy!
