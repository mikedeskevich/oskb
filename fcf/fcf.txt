   Power clean
   Front squat
   Push press
   Back squat
   Push press
   This is an awesome workout that will test your mental capabilities as
   well as your physical. Each exercise will be done for one rep seven
   time through. The power clean is touch and go. You cannot put the bar
   down at any time during the seven sets. That is one round. Add weight
   and rest as needed between rounds. Your goal is to complete all five
   rounds unbroken and finishing the 5th round  with as heavy as possible.

   In this workout you move from each of five stations after a minute.
   This is a five-minute round from which a one-minute break is allowed
   before repeating. We've used this in 3 and 5 round versions. The
   stations are:
    1. Wall-ball: 20 pound ball, 10 ft target. (Reps)
    2. Sumo deadlift high-pull: 75 pounds (Reps)
    3. Box Jump: 20" box (Reps)
    4. Push-press: 75 pounds (Reps)
    5. Row: calories (Calories)

   The clock does not reset or stop between exercises. On call of
   "rotate," the athlete/s must move to next station immediately for good
   score. One point is given for each rep, except on the rower where each
   calorie is one point.

   In this workout you move from each of five stations after a minute.
   This is a five-minute round from which a one-minute break is allowed
   before repeating. We've used this in 3 and 5 round versions. The
   stations are:
   1. Wall-ball: 20 pound ball, 10 ft target. (Reps)
   2. Sumo deadlift high-pull: 75 pounds (Reps)
   3. Box Jump: 20" box (Reps)
   4. Push-press: 75 pounds (Reps)
   5. Row: calories (Calories)
   The clock does not reset or stop between exercises. On call of
   "rotate," the athlete/s must move to next station immediately for good
   score. One point is given for each rep, except on the rower where each
   calorie is one point.
