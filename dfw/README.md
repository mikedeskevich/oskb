# Dry Fighting Weight

Dry Fighting Weight is a very popular template, and one that has many variations. Folks have been playing with this one for years. There is no one true way to do it.  The template I like has a combination of ladders, rest days and uneven volume to get a bit of a wave effect.

The week starts with ladders, and that's the hardest workout of the week.  Tuesday is some heavy swings for hip extension, but nothing else.  Monday will be your grind, Tuesday is your tonic.  Wednesday and Thursday are easier press days.  I like to push the pace on Wednesday, since it's lower volume sets.  Friday is your true AGT day.  Fast, powerful, lots of rest.
