# Vodka and Pickles

This is my interpretation of the classic Vodka and Pickles deadlift program

1. Start your deadlift very light, say 60% of your 1RM.
2. Pick a kettlebell pull. I like heavy swings in twenty sets of 5.
3. Pick a squat movement. I like double kettlebell front squats in 4-6 sets of 5.

Do this three days a week. Start with deadlifts, and then on alternate days do the kettlebell pull *or* squats.  

| Workout | Deadlifts then Accessory  |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| **1**   | 15x1x60%                  |
| **2**   | 15x1x65%                  |
| **3**   | 12x1x70%                  |
| **4**   | 8x1x75%                   |
| **5**   | 6x1x80%                   |
| **...** | Add 10 lbs and start over |

Run this cycle for a couple of weeks and then retest your deadlift.
