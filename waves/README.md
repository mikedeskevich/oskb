# Waves Of Strength

A while ago, some folks from the StrongFirst community published a few sample templates for an interesting wave-the-load style program.  These were originally designed around the barbell lifts, but I've successfully used them for kettlebell work, and even have modifications that work well for multiple lifts.

I have two waves that I borrowed from other programs [insert ref when I find it], one is the "Short Wave" which is 12 workouts - 3 days a week for 4 weeks. The other is the "Long Wave" which is much more volume per day and a longer cycle 18 workouts - 3 days a week for 6 weeks.

Both waves were originally written for a single barbell lift and you were to put in your own low-volume, low-intensity accessory work.  Or do some power-based kettlebell work on the off-days.  I've made a few additions that allow you to have multiple out-of-phase waves so that you can wave multiple movements.

The basic waves use weights that are 75%, 85%, and 90% of your 1RM.  Since the volume is high, use your "Technical 1RM" which is the heaviest you can lift while still having perfect technique - not the most you've ever lifted when the moon was in the right phase and the stars were aligned.  There's enough volume and frequency of movement here that you want perfect practice and the strength stimulus comes from that. 

When it's kettlebell work, I just call it "Light","Medium", and "Heavy".  Where the heavy bell is your 1RM for the movement, and then Medium is one bell size (4kg) less and light is another bell size down.  That seems to work the best.  If you're doing single arm bell movements, then count each arm separately.  

For example, 3x75% of double kettlebell press would be 3 with your light bell. For single-arm press, it would be 3 of each arm sequentially with the light bell.  The single short wave and long wave are enough work for barbell exercises. I've found that a single wave is probably not enough with the kettlebell lifts, and you should pair or triple them up.

## Short Wave

The short wave is a cycle of 12 workouts done, one done each day.  

| Workout | Sets & Reps                              |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1       | 3x75%, 2x85%                             |
| 2       | 2x75%, 2x85%, 2x85%, 2x75%               |
| 3       | 4x75%, 3x75%, 3x85%, 3x85%               |
| 4       | 2x75%, 2x75%, 3x85%                      |
| 5       | 3x75%, 3x85%, 2x85%, 3x75%               |
| 6       | 5x75%, 4x75%, 1x90%, 3x85%, 3x85%, 2x85% |
| 7       | 2x85%, 2x85%                             |
| 8       | 1x75%, 3x85%, 3x85%                      |
| 9       | 1x75%, 1x90%, 3x85%, 3x85%, 2x85%, 2x85% |
| 10      | 1x75%, 2x85%                             |
| 11      | 2x75%, 2x85%                             |
| 12      | 3x75%, 1x90%, 2x85%, 2x85%               |

You'd follow this with a single movement of choice (typically a big barbell lift, Squat, Press, Deadlift,...) 3 days a week for 4 weeks.  On each day below, use the workout number from above.

|            | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Week 1** | 1     | 2     | 3     |
| **Week 2** | 4     | 5     | 6     |
| **Week 3** | 7     | 8     | 9     |
| **Week 4** | 10    | 11    | 12    |

## Long Wave

The Long Wave is 18 workouts, the over all volume is large and the long days also have more volume. This is a much harder wave than the Short Wave


| Workout | Sets & Reps                                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1       | 3x75%, 2x85%, 2x85%, 3x75%                             |
| 2       | 2x75%, 2x75%, 2x85%, 2x85%, 2x85%, 2x75%, 2x75%        |
| 3       | 4x75%, 3x75%, 3x85%, 3x85%, 3x75%, 3x75%               |
| 4       | 4x75%, 2x85%, 3x85%, 4x75%, 2x75%                      |
| 5       | 3x75%, 4x75%, 3x75%, 3x85%, 2x85%, 4x75%, 3x75%        |
| 6       | 3x75%, 5x75%, 4x75%, 3x75%, 1x90%, 3x85%, 3x85%, 2x85% |
| 7       | 2x85%, 2x85%, 4x75%, 4x75%                             |
| 8       | 4x75%, 3x75%, 3x85%, 3x85%, 4x75%, 3x75%               |
| 9       | 4x75%, 1x90%, 3x85%, 3x85%, 2x85%, 2x85%               |
| 10      | 4x75%, 2x85%, 2x85%, 4x75%                             |
| 11      | 4x75%, 2x85%, 2x85%                                    |
| 12      | 3x75%, 3x75%, 1x90%, 2x85%, 2x85%, 2x85%               |
| 13      | 4x75%, 3x85%, 2x85%                                    |
| 14      | 4x75%, 3x85%, 2x85%, 3x75%, 3x75%                      |
| 15      | 5x75%, 4x75%, 3x75%, 1x90%, 3x85%, 3x85%, 2x85%        |
| 16      | 3x75%, 2x85%                                           |
| 17      | 3x75%, 3x75%, 2x75%                                    |
| 18      | 3x75%, 3x75%, 1x85%, 1x90%                             |

You'd follow this with a single movement of choice 3 days a week for 6 weeks.  On each day below, use the workout number from above. This is good for the quick barbell lifts (Snatch, C&J) and I love it for the Kettlebell Grinds (Press, Squats, etc.)  I never liked it for the heavy barbell lifts, it always crushed me.  

|            | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Week 1** | 1     | 2     | 3     |
| **Week 2** | 4     | 5     | 6     |
| **Week 3** | 7     | 8     | 9     |
| **Week 4** | 10    | 11    | 12    |
| **Week 5** | 13    | 14    | 15    |
| **Week 6** | 16    | 17    | 18    |

## Multiple Waves

The above waves are not my original work (when I find the reference, I'll credit the author). What I did (and had great success using for many people) is to set up multiple wave out of phase (so that the heavy days don't coincide, for example).  

My method was to create a single intensity measure for each of the 12 (or 18) workouts.  And then offset the cycle, and compute the variance of the intensity for each day.  The offset with the lowest total variance across all possible offsets is the one I used for each of the multiple wave cycles.  (Yes, this is an O(N<sup>M</sup>) algorithm, but it's still quick here.  N is 12 of 18 and I don't use an M larger than 6.)

The intensity measurement I used was the classic INOLS which rates volume and fraction of 1RM together into a single reference value. 

## Double Wave

For the double wave you pick two movements.  They are perfectly out of phase so that the heavy day for one movement is the light day for the other (on average across all 12 days).

Read this table as a pair of workouts (i,j) where you do workout i (in the tables above) for your first movement, and workout j for the second movement. 

For example, below on Week 1, Day 1, you'll do 3x75%, 2x85% for movement number 1 and 1x75%, 3x85%, 3x85% for movement number 2.

| Short Wave | Day 1  | Day 2  | Day 3  |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **Week 1** | (1,8)  | (2,9)  | (3,10) |
| **Week 2** | (4,11) | (5,12) | (6,1)  |
| **Week 3** | (7,2)  | (8,3)  | (9,4)  |
| **Week 4** | (10,5) | (11,6) | (12,7) |

I'm sure you can see how the pattern of offsets goes. 

| Long Wave | Day 1  | Day 2  | Day 3  |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **Week 1** | (1,11)  | (2,12) | (3,13) |
| **Week 2** | (4,14) | (5,15) | (6,16) |
| **Week 3** | (7,17) | (8,18) | (9,1) |
| **Week 4** | (10,2) | (11,3) | (12,4) |
| **Week 5** | (13,5) | (14,6) | (15,7) |
| **Week 6** | (16,8) | (17,9) | (18,10) |

## Triple Wave

The triple wave, as you guessed, is three out-of-phase movements with an offset that minimized total variance for the full cycle.  This was my favorite, and I've used it successfully on the big three (Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift) and also for many choices of Kettlebell movements. I've also mixed and matched Barbells and Kettlebells. By far my favorite wave cycle.

| Short Wave | Day 1   | Day 2 | Day 3 |
| ---------- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| **Week 1** | (1,3,8) | (2,4,9) | (3,5,10) |
| **Week 2** | (4,6,11) | (5,7,12) | (6,8,1) |
| **Week 3** | (7,9,2) | (8,10,3) | (9,11,4) |
| **Week 4** | (10,12,5) | (11,1,6) | (12,2,7) |

| Long Wave | Day 1  | Day 2  | Day 3  |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **Week 1** | (1,9,14) | (2,10,15) | (3,11,16) |
| **Week 2** | (4,12,17) | (5,13,18) | (6,14,1) |
| **Week 3** | (7,15,2) | (8,16,3) | (9,17,4) |
| **Week 4** | (10,18,5) | (11,1,6) | (12,2,7) |
| **Week 5** | (13,3,8) | (14,4,9) | (15,5,10) |
| **Week 6** | (16,6,11) | (17,7,12) | (18,8,13) |

## Hexa Wave

There are two good variants for the Hexa Wave.  You can do all six movement on one day - probably too much unless they're ligher options - or you can do 3 each day for a 6-day cycle.  This gives you two interlaced waves.

| Short Wave | Day 1          | Day 2      | Day 3      |
| ---------- | -------------- | ---------- | ---------- |

## Code To Generate Waves

I created an [IDL](https://www.harrisgeospatial.com/docs/using_idl_home.html) script (waves.pro) to generate these waves with the proper offsets for the best volume separation.
