# Open Source Kettlebell Project

## What is OSKB?

I'm a computational mathematician by trade, and for a while owned a gym in beautiful Boulder, Colorado that specialized in Olympic Weightlifting and Kettlebell Training.  Over the years I developed some good systems to program kettlebells to fit into everyday life and as a supplement to folks who spend their fun times in the mountains to the west.  

I figured I should have a central repository of these programs, and in the spirit of open source software, I'm sharing them here and welcome branches and modifications. The more we play with these the more we'll learn.

Most of these programs have been heavily inspired by folks much smarter than me.  I don't claim that any of this in my original material.  But I have made modification or adjustments to most of them to fit my style or my student's needs.  I'm only including programs I've done or assigned to others *and* had success with. Many of these templates have come from other copyrighted material, I hope that what I have here doesn't steal anyone's IP since I've made original modifications to them based on my experiences. But if anyone owns the IP for any of these workouts and you don't want them here, I'm happy to take them down, just let me know. 

## Why Am I Doing This?

My gym never got big enough for me to quit my day job, and since I decided to shut it down, I'd like to share the methods I built up over the years. Most of this is going to just be a collection of programs or scripts to generate programs, there's not going to be much context into the whys or hows.  I'll still do consulting for people wanting expert advice. Think of this as the typical OSS method of giving the source away but still charging for support.

## I'm Just Starting To Fill This Out

I don't have a ton of free time, so I'll start filling this out slowly.  I welcome comments on the programs! Try them out, give me feed back. Branch and make changes and modifications!  I hope turn this into a great repository of strength training knowledge. 

## Attribution

You're free to use these. I ask two things: 1) properly attribute this if you publish any of it, and 2) reply to me with results or modifications you made - I want the entire community to learn.

## Contributing
