# Tactical Strength Challenge

There are many ways to prepare for the TSC.  I hope to have a bunch of programs here so you can pick what works for you.

## Old Guy TSC Prep

This is one that I used in 2018 for the TSC.  By this point in my training, I had very solid performance in all of the events, and I was old enough that I had to be reasonable in my recovery. I pulled a PR deadlift (465) in the event and performed near my best on the other two events. So I call it a success.
